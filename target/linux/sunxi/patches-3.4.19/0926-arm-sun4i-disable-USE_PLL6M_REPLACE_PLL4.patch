Subject: [PATCH 926/944] arm: sun4i: disable USE_PLL6M_REPLACE_PLL4
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Given the issues with SATA and Mali that the different clocks caused,
this patch disables USE_PLL6M_REPLACE_PLL4 so PLL6 and PLL4 become
two independent clocks on A10 rev C devices.

This way, we keep SATA working with a PLL6 at 1.2Ghz and PLL4 remains
operational as 960Mhz for video decoding and Mali.

According to Tom, USE_PLL6M_REPLACE_PLL4 was created to work around
a problem with PLL4 on rev C hardware that would cause video
decoding to fail, but I have not experienced any such issues
during my testing on said hardware revision.
